Complete the steps for setting up the ArgoCD tool

</PageDescription>

## Overview

ArgoCD is the [Developer Tools environment's continuous delivery tool](/guides/continuous-delivery).
Before you can use it as part of the environment, it must first be configured.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up ArgoCD, [set up Artifactory](/getting-started/artifactory-setup) so that ArgoCD can use it.

##  Configuration

Configure ArgoCD to use Artifactory.

### Clone the ArgoCD repository

The ArgoCD repository contains files and samples for configuring ArgoCD.

- Clone the repository to your development machine

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/template-argocd-test
  cd template-argocd-test
  ```

### Get the Helm repository location

The Helm repository is in Artifactory. ArgoCD will need the URL to that repository.

- In the Artifactory console, select the Home page

- In the Set Me Up section, click on the `generic-local` repository

  ![Set Me Up - Repositories](setupartifactory.png "Set Me Up: Repositories")

- In the Set Me Up dialog for the generic-local repository, copy the Deploy URL

  ![Set Me Up - Generic Local Repository](artifactoryurlsetup.png "Set Me Up: generic-local Repository")

### Update the ArgoCD configuration file

The repo you cloned contains an ArgoCD configuration file. Put the Helm repository location in that file
and deploy it to your Developer Tools environment.

- Test to confirm that your shell is logged into your cluster

  ```bash
  kubectl version --short
  ```

- In your local copy of the `template-argocd-test` repo, run `./config/addhelmrepository.sh [artifact-helm-repository-location]`

    where `[artifact-helm-repository-location]` URL of the Helm repository location in Artifactory

Verify that the new configuration has deployed

- In the Kubernetes dashboard or OpenShift console, navigate to the Config Maps in the `tools` namespace

- Select the `argocd-cm` config map and confirm that its `helm.repositories` property specifies the Artifactory URL

## Conclusion

ArgoCD now has the configuration file in the Developer Tools environment that it needs to access the Helm chart repository in Artifactory.
