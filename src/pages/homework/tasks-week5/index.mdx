Session 4 of the MOOC focuses on Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I) and it has been installed with single sign on in the IBM Cloud in the same way a client
  would have it configured for their account. This gives you access to all the software that is included in the
   **CP4I** offering, see the welcome screen below.
