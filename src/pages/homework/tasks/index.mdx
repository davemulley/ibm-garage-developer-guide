## Session 1, Week 1 -- The Day 1 Developer Experience

<InlineNotification>

Before you proceed, make sure you have signed up for the MOOC development environment. It is a paid IBM Cloud account with the [Developer Tools environment](/overview) already installed and ready for you to use, including both a Kubernetes cluster and an OpenShift cluster. (The environment is locked down to prevent creating any new services.) Also, before proceeding:
- Be sure you have already done the [Welcome to your MOOC team](/homework/teams) tasks
- Install the [IBM Garage for Cloud CLI](/getting-started/cli) (again) to ensure you have the latest version

</InlineNotification>

Week 1 of the MOOC focuses on the Day 1 Developer Experience: How to use the Developer Tools envionment to develop and deploy a basic cloud-native application. In this MOOC, we'll deploy it to Red Hat OpenShift.

This homework assumes that you have:
 - Reviewed the Playback from the Week 1 Monday session
 - Seen a demo of each of the homework tasks below
 - Seen demos and discussion about what is expected from the homework

### Homework Review Week 1

The homework review will take the form of a retrospective for the attendees who have completed the homework tasks. We are looking for feedback from three perspectives:

- **What went well?**
- **What needs improvement?**
- **Next steps?**

Students will begin this **MOOC** with different skill levels and familiarity with this material, but will complete the MOOC ready to perform a Garage engagement. Each student's **Next Steps** will help identify that person's skill gaps to ensure they cover the topics needed to complete the **MOOC** successfully.

Please use the [online retrospective](https://reetro-io.herokuapp.com/board/5dc4fca0074a5400170d9c93/5dc4fca0074a5400170d9c95) board during the live Homework session to evaluate the session. As students enter feedback, we'll all be able to see it on this shared screen.
