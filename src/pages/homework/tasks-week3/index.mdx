### Homework Review Week 3

The homework review will take the form of a show-and-tell and a retrospective. The show-and-tell includes a description of tasks that didn't go so well. It will close with a retrospective for the attendees who have completed the homework tasks. We are looking for feedback from three perspectives:
- **What went well?**
- **What needs improvement?**
- **Next steps?**

Please use the [online retrospective](https://reetro-io.herokuapp.com/board/5dd8b70091a43c001725ade8/5dd8b77791a43c001725adf2) board during the live Homework session to evaluate the session. As students enter feedback, we'll all be able to see it on this shared screen.
